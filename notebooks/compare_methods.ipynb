    "# Optical Gating Alignment Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope of this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook accompanies our python module for optical gating reference period alignment algorithms: optical_gating_alignment, which can be found at https://github.com/Glasgow-ICG/optical-gating-alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have downloaded the repository from the above link then everything required for this notebook should be in the right place.\n",
    "This includes a data set that contains 30 multipage .tif files showing example reference heartbeats collected every approx. 15 minutes during a real adaptive optical gating timelapse experiment. This data folder also includes two .csv data files.\n",
    "One with the determined period, timestamp and drift for each reference set.\n",
    "One with manually identified target frames for each reference set from five different scorers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will install the optical_gating_alignment module in your Python environment using pip.\n",
    "If you do not want this you should edit the notebook first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to produce a demonstration of the quality of synchronisation algorithms. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A plot of the stability of different algorithms for adaptive optical gating-based phase-locking by comparing human and computational derived target frames, i.e. figure 3b. Please note that neither the human or computational derived targets can be considered 'ground truths' and are compared to indicate stability not precision/accuracy.\n",
    "* 'Flick books', each showing the phase-lock over time (compared to the mean manual result) for different algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "For users interested in following the outputs of our adaptive optical gating systems, i.e. the phase-locked target frame, we draw their attentions to the lines that call the `oga.process_sequence()` function, particularly the output variable `global_roll_factor`.\n",
